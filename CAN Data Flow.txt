/* DATA FLOW FOR CAN OPERATION:

amon should be running.  This sets up the CAN IPC memory and will transmit & 
	receive msgs.

avisual_main.cpp -  Has a background polling of "void can_interface()"
					This function checks if CAN ipc memory is present,
					and if so, it checks if a new message has been received.
					if so, it dispatches the msg to all receivers (see CAN_dispatcher.cpp)
					
					Each call of the function will check for the IPC presence and 
					connect if positive.						
					
		Visual_main.cpp sets up one such receiver :						
			CAN_add_rx_callback( callback_tilt_reading );
			
		That receiver "callback_tilt_reading" is in 
			fuse_ag.c 

	CAN_App  adds itself as a receiver in the Initialize().
