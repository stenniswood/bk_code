This code handles IPC Shared memory:  atiltcam
Intended for the PiCamScan board on RaspberryPi.

WRITES TO SHARED MEMORY:
	Analog 	
READS:
	Lowside Outputs	- this app reserves the right to override the outputs based on the application.
	Servo Angles

// always support dave on his h speech eh?
// okay let's try that appoach.  isn't that what kathy W is doing.
// uplifting then i get dave's favor more.


// yeah, if lp knew how to handle dave exactly, that would be something i don't know.
// and there probably are levels of things which i don't know yet.

// i never sucessfully did those code reviews.  I never walked away with respect and trust
// from my teammates.  So it seems i better go back redo all the things i worked at before 
//  and this time pass them.  It's the social things i need to learn, not the coding.

// simultaneously this coding stuff is getting very laborious.
// Nothing comes for free.
// I am literally fighting entropy.  Every single aspect of the design needs direct attention.
// You'd think well there's 2 servos just copy one to the next.  But now there's a power issue!
// 

// do i write this because i have no friends.  Yes.
// it's much better to get $50/hr job.  life will be 100% better probably.
// I wish i knew more of what i don't know.  I have no map of what i don't know.
