How does the Instant server work?

	Two Different ways of connecting to Instant:
		a) Client app (uses cli shared memory)
		b) TCP/IP client connect 


instant_main starts a listening thread - this loops infinitely, waiting for any new connections
	If one comes in :
			for each client which connects, we generate a ServerHandler(), 
			call it's accept() (the object holds the file descriptor of the socket)
			start a connection thread (connection_handler()) and 
			add it to a list of connections server_handlers()

			see files:  threads/listen.cpp, core/nlp/serverthread.cpp
			
	The connection_handler() loops until the socket is closed from the other side 
			(ie. read returns 0 eof)
			It keeps checking for incoming messages and gives them to the NLP parser.
			Responses are formulated and sent back.
